## 🧠 Conversion Psychology Principles

### 1. Trust Before Ask

**Principle**: Build trust before asking for commitment

**Implementation**:
- Instructor profiles visible before CTA
- Student count displayed prominently
- Reviews/ratings shown early
- Experience highlighted

**Why**:
- ✅ Reduces anxiety (they know who they're learning from)
- ✅ Social proof (others have succeeded)

### 2. Clarity Over Cleverness

**Principle**: Clear information, not clever copy

**Implementation**:

- Program duration (transparency)
- What's included (value proposition)
- Prerequisites (manages expectations)

**Why**:
- ✅ Reduces confusion (clear expectations)
- ✅ Builds trust (transparency)
- ✅ Reduces friction (no surprises)

### 3. Scarcity (Subtle, Not Aggressive)

**Principle**: Create urgency without pressure

**Implementation**:
- "Sınırlı kontenjan: 15 kişi" (limited spots)
- "Son başvuru: 15 Mart" (deadline)
- "Bir sonraki program: Nisan 2024" (next cohort)

**Why**:
- ✅ Creates urgency (limited availability)
- ✅ Respectful (not pushy)
- ✅ Luxury brand (subtle, not aggressive)

### 4. Social Proof (Throughout Journey)

**Principle**: Show others have succeeded

**Implementation**:

**Why**:

## 🎯 CTA Strategy

### Primary CTA: "Hemen Başvur" (Apply Now)

**Placement Hierarchy**:

1. **Hero Section** (Above Fold) ✅
   - **Why**: First impression, highest visibility
   - **Position**: Below H1, prominent
   - **Style**: Gold accent, subtle glow

2. **Sticky Header** (Always Reachable) ✅
   - **Why**: Always accessible (conversion best practice)
   - **Position**: Right side of header
   - **Style**: Smaller, but always visible

3. **Course Cards** (Contextual) ✅
   - **Why**: User is interested (contextual)
   - **Position**: On each course card
   - **Style**: Subtle, not overwhelming

4. **Floating CTA** (Mobile, After Scroll) ⚠️
   - **Why**: Screen space limited on mobile
   - **Position**: Bottom right, after 50% scroll
   - **Style**: Dismissible, respects reduced motion
   - **Rule**: Use sparingly (can annoy)

### CTA Copy Justification

**"Hemen Başvur"** (Apply Now):
- ✅ **Direct**: Action-oriented, clear
- ✅ **Turkish**: Localized for target audience
- ✅ **Premium Feel**: "Başvur" implies application process (not just "sign up")

**Why Not "Kayıt Ol"** (Sign Up):
- ❌ Too generic (feels like free service)
- ❌ Doesn't match brand (luxury, not freemium)

**Why Not "Ücretsiz Deneme"** (Free Trial):
- ❌ Doesn't match brand (premium, not freemium)
- ❌ Sets wrong expectations (not a free service)

### CTA Motion Timing

**Hover**: 240ms (fast, responsive)
- **Why**: Feels instant, not sluggish

**Click**: Immediate feedback (no delay)
- **Why**: User expects instant response

**Entrance**: 420ms (smooth, not rushed)
- **Why**: Feels intentional, not "webby"

**Why This Timing**:
- ✅ **Fast Response**: 240ms feels instant (research-backed)
- ✅ **Smooth Entrance**: 420ms feels intentional
- ✅ **No Distraction**: Motion guides, doesn't distract
